## Base NodeJS Server v0.0.1

### Introduction

This application serves as the base NodeJS server folder for developing NodeJS severs. This is a very basic boiler plate web server created. It has been documented, but I always strive to do better. Some key features for this applications are -
It has Mongoose models for database schema, Joi models and middlewares for request validations. It has routes and controllers pre configured. It also has JWT as authentication. It has utilities functions for usual tasks. It has MongoDB configured.

### Running the application

Run `nodemon app.js` for development server. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) for accessing API. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Documentation for the application

Run `npm run jsdoc` for generating documentation. Check [index.html](documentation/index.html) or use live server to access `http://127.0.0.1:5500/backend/documentation/` folder for documentation.
