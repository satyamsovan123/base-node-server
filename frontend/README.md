# Base Frontend v0.0.1

<br>

## Introduction

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.
This application serves as the frontend for [base-node-server](https://github.com/base-node-server) application.
This is a very minimal and basic single page web application to quickly test out the server in the browser. It has been [documented](index.html), but I always strive to do better.

## Running the application

Run `ng serve` or `npm run development` for development server. Run `npm run production` for production server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Documentation for the application

Run `npm run compdoc` for generating documentation. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5500/frontend/documentation/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/frontend/documentation/index.html) for the documentation.

## Building the application (for production)

Run `npm build` for generating production build files. Navigate to [dist](../dist) folder to see the files.
